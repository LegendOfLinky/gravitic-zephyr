# Gravitic Zephyr

An arcade-style spaceflight simulation game inspired by orbital mechanics. Navigate your spacecraft through planetary systems and experience the challenges of realistic orbital dynamics.

## About
Gravitic Zephyr combines arcade-style gameplay with realistic orbital physics, creating an engaging space navigation experience. Players must carefully plan their trajectories while managing their spacecraft's momentum through various planetary systems.

## Features
* Real-time orbital simulation with interactive controls
* Dynamic guide arcs for trajectory planning
* Expansive space environment with multiple planetary bodies

## How to Play

## Inspiration
* **Kerbal Space Program**: For its focus on realistic yet approachable orbital mechanics
* **Lunar Lander**: The classic arcade game that emphasized precision and control
* **Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous** by Buzz Aldrin: The fundamental principles of this PhD thesis still underpin modern orbital mechanics

## Roadmap
* Add additional planetary bodies
* Improve visual design of the ship
* Add a planet-centric spacecraft guide arc
* Add planetary landing capabilities
* Add "auto-reset" zone outside spheres of influence
